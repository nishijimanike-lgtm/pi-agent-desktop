 * Layout sentinels.
 *
 * The first two guard upstream segment D regressions (0e36743):
 *
 * 1. The "Center: chat" column closed right after the topbar, turning the
 *    chat wrapper into a second flex:1 ROW child: the viewport split 50/50
 *    between an empty topbar column and the chat (the "huge blank middle").
 * 2. The right-panel toggle/backdrop/resizer/panel block sat AFTER the row
 *    close, i.e. as flex-COLUMN children of .app-shell: the closed panel's
 *    content height still stole vertical space from the chat row.
 *
 * The third pins the 2026-09 full-height sidebar restructure: the sidebar is
 * a direct child of the outer row and the topbar moved into the main column
 * that follows it, so the topbar starts at the center column and the sidebar
 * runs the full window height (no blank strip above the sidebar).
