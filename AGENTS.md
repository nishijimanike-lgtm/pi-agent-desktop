# Pi Web - Development Notes

## Quick Start

```bash
npm run dev   # port 30141
```

Typecheck: `node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit`  
Lint: `npm run lint`  
**Never run `next build` during dev** — pollutes `.next/` and breaks `npm run dev`.

**Session browsing** (read-only): reads `.jsonl` files through SDK `SessionManager` helpers and `lib/session-reader.ts` — no AgentSession created.  
**Sending a message**: `startRpcSession()` in `lib/rpc-manager.ts` creates an AgentSession in-process.

## Key Design Decisions & Traps

### AgentSession lifecycle (`lib/rpc-manager.ts`)
- One `AgentSessionWrapper` per session id, keyed in `globalThis.__piSessions`
- `globalThis` survives Next.js hot-reload; plain module-level Map does not
- Idle timeout: 10 minutes. Concurrent `startRpcSession()` calls share a single start Promise (`globalThis.__piStartLocks`)

### Fork must destroy the wrapper immediately
`AgentSession.fork()` **mutates the wrapper's inner state in-place** — after fork, `inner.sessionId` is the *new* session's id. If the wrapper stays alive in the registry under the old id, the next request gets the already-forked state and subsequent forks produce a corrupt `parentSession` chain.

**Fix**: `send("fork")` captures `newSessionId`, then calls `this.destroy()` before returning. The next request for the original session reloads a clean AgentSession from the original file.

### Two kinds of branching — don't confuse them
- **Fork** (Fork button on user message): creates a new independent `.jsonl` file. Shown as a child in the sidebar tree via `parentSession` header field.
- **In-session branch** (Continue button / BranchNavigator): calls `navigate_tree` within the same file. Multiple entries share the same `parentId`. Switching between them calls `/api/sessions/[id]/context?leafId=`.

### Session files can be fully rewritten
`parentSession` in the header is **display metadata only** — has zero effect on chat content. Safe to `writeFileSync` the entire file (pi does this itself during migrations). Used when cascade-reparenting children on delete.

### A new session has no file until pi flushes it
Pi delays the first flush of a new session until an assistant message exists, so a run that just started is invisible to the disk scan behind `/api/sessions`. The sidebar list is derived purely from `.jsonl` files, so without help the session the user is actively watching cannot be found in the list until the turn ends.
- `/api/sessions` merges live runtime rows via `getRpcSessionInfos()` (`lib/rpc-manager.ts`) with `mergeSessionLists()` (`lib/session-reader.ts`); the disk row wins for a persisted id, and a runtime row is suppressed until a user message exists (otherwise an untouched "new chat" runtime renders a row that later vanishes). `ensure_session`-created idle runtimes are also suppressed.
- Sessions created by subagents carry a `relation: { kind: "subagent", ... }`; sidebar rows for subagents are hidden and their state aggregates into the parent row (`listSessionFamilies` in `lib/session-family.ts`).
- The disk scan behind the list is the fork's incremental scanner (`lib/session-scan.ts`), cached per file keyed on mtime+size, so post-turn refreshes only re-parse the session that changed. `invalidateScannedSession(path)` drops one file's cache entry; `invalidateSessionListCache()` drops the list itself. Include symlinked project directories when touching the directory walk.
- `GET /api/sessions` returns a `sessionListVersion` counter; the sidebar's SSE handler refetches the list (reusing the invalidated server cache, no forced scan) whenever the version moves — that is how edits from another window/process appear.
- The sidebar refetches the list once per running id it has no row for, because a session can start running between list fetches.

### Event pipeline: SDK → wire → client (`lib/agent-event-stream.ts`, `lib/agent-event-wire.ts`)
- Per-agent SSE goes through `createAgentEventStream(req, id, sessionPromise)`: the session starts **asynchronously** (the route never `await`s `startRpcSession`), the stream filters events through `toClientAgentEvent()` and forwards them with one shared `TextEncoder`. Cancellation is `cancelStream(closeController)`; closing with `false` keeps the session's own listeners alive.
- The sidebar's running-id stream (`/api/agent/running/events`) keeps the older inline `dispose` pattern and must stay registered in `app/api/agent/events-route.test.mjs`.
- `subscribeRunningSessions()`/`notifyRunningChange()` in `rpc-manager.ts` broadcast the running-id set; `SessionSidebar` treats the stream as authoritative for running state (`sseAuthoritativeRef`) once connected, and a `sessionListVersion` bump on any SSE frame triggers a cache-reusing list refetch.

### Session listing: incremental scanner vs upstream catalogue
- `lib/session-scan.ts` replaces `SessionManager.listAll()`: same per-file info minus `allMessagesText`, cached per file keyed on mtime+size (`globalThis.__piSessionScanCache`). Only files whose mtime/size changed are re-parsed. `invalidateScannedSession(path)` forces one file's reparse; `invalidateSessionListCache()` drops the merged list cache. Symlinked project dirs are included.
- `resolveSessionPath()` tries a targeted header read (bounded to 4 KiB) before falling back to a full scan; `readSessionHeader()` never parses the whole file.
- Never reintroduce a literal `homedir()` into an fs call in these paths — route it through `userHome()` or the scanner walks the whole user profile at build time and Windows releases fail.

### Client session hook: guards you must keep when merging upstream (`hooks/useAgentSession.ts`)
- **Monotonic request ids**: `contextLoadIdRef`/`toolsLoadIdRef`/`sessionGenerationRef` — checking only the session id is not enough when the user switches A→B→A before a request settles. `loadContext`/`loadTools`/the `agent_end` refresh all capture and re-verify identity.
- **Session-load deadline**: `loadSession` fetches through `fetchWithRetry` (one retry with a longer deadline); a hung first attempt must not leave "loading session" forever.
- **Streaming seed**: `seedStreamingSnapshot()` re-hydrates the streaming bubble from `get_state.streamingMessage` on reconnect paths (page refresh mid-run).
- **Render-phase scroll save**: the departing session's scroll position is saved inside the `sessionIdentity !== appliedIdentity` render block, not in an effect cleanup — the browser clamps scrollTop to 0 before cleanup runs. `pendingInitialScrollTopRef` is consumed by the first-messages layout effect; upstream's `pendingScrollRestore` visibility gate hides the container until an in-page viewport restore lands.

### Thinking-level state model (post-0.9.1)
Four states, not one: `newSessionThinkingLevel` (composer pre-send), `newSessionDefaultThinkingLevel` (from `/api/models` pins + `defaultThinkingLevel`), `currentThinkingOverride` (explicit user choice), `liveThinkingLevel` (wrapper-reported). `thinkingLevel` returned to the UI is `displayThinkingLevel ?? "auto"`. "auto" clears all overrides and leaves pi's setting untouched. The selector prefers the live wrapper model/thinking over persisted response metadata.

### Security posture from the upstream main merge
- `PI_WEB_PASSWORD` (off by default) enables browser password login with `pi_web_session` cookie (SameSite=Lax) and global backoff throttling (`lib/auth-throttle.ts`). When disabled, loopback/desktop-token paths behave exactly as before — desktop token auth is independent.
- Manual-code OAuth handshake tokens are `crypto.randomUUID()`; never revert to Math.random.
- Inline SVG previews opened as documents get a CSP that blocks script execution (`HTML_PREVIEW_CSP` in the files route).

### ToolCall field normalization
Pi stores toolCall blocks as `{type:"toolCall", id, name, arguments}` but `ToolCallContent` uses `{toolCallId, toolName, input}`. `normalizeToolCalls()` in `lib/normalize.ts` handles this — called in both `session-reader.ts` (file load) and `ChatWindow.handleAgentEvent()` (streaming).

### New session tool preset
Tool names are passed at session creation (`POST /api/agent/new` -> `toolNames[]`) and persisted in versioned `pi-web:tool-selection` custom entries. No entry means a legacy session and keeps Pi's default behavior; an empty array means Chat only. Chat only resolves before services are created, loads no extensions/skills/prompts/themes, and replaces Pi's base prompt with the ordered contents of Pi's discovered context files. Crossing the Chat-only boundary rebuilds the wrapper; changing between nonempty presets updates it in place.

**Exact system prompts go through `before_agent_start`.** Since pi 0.86 the prompt lives in the transcript: `agent.state.systemPrompt` is a getter replayed from persisted system messages (assigning it throws), and the agent loop's request context has no `systemPrompt` field, so neither mutating the state nor patching `prepareNextTurnWithContext` reaches the model. Chat-only sessions and subagent profiles in replace mode register `lib/exact-system-prompt.ts` as an inline extension factory on the resource loader; its `before_agent_start` handler returns `{ systemPrompt }`, which the SDK projects as the provider's leading system prompt for the whole run while the transcript keeps recording Pi's structured sections. `get_state.systemPrompt` reports the exact prompt for those wrappers because the SDK state only shows the structured sections. Subagents persist their active tools plus profile-level skill and extension loading switches in `resourceSnapshot`; loaded extensions cannot expose the reserved `Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, or `steer_subagent` tools to a subagent. See `docs/adr/0002-chat-only-tool-selection.md`.

### pi ≥ 0.86: `state.systemPrompt` is read-only — project, never assign
`AgentState.systemPrompt` became a getter replayed from the transcript's system messages; assigning it throws at runtime (tsc only catches this in code typed against the real SDK — `rpc-manager.ts` goes through the structural `AgentSessionLike`, where it is invisible). `AgentSessionWrapper.applyExactSystemPrompt()` therefore installs an `agent.transformContext` projection that collapses each outgoing request's head system message to the exact prompt (the same mechanism pi itself uses for `before_agent_start` forced prompts); `get_state` reports `exactSystemPrompt()` directly so the UI's tools-disabled gate keeps working. Stream functions take a `TranscriptContext` now — fold a `Context` with `normalizeContext()` before calling one (see `lib/session-title.ts`). The session-list scanner replicates 0.86 `listAll()` ordering: modified descending, ties by stat mtime then basename descending.

### Model defaults for new sessions
`GET /api/models` returns `defaultModel` read from `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`. `ChatWindow` pre-selects this on mount for new sessions. Explicit browser model/thinking selections are applied atomically during AgentSession construction, then `lib/startup-preferences.ts` persists their effective values without replaying `set_model`/`set_thinking_level`; implicit `enabledModels` fallbacks and thinking pins are not persisted.

### Remote provider catalogs
pi's built-in model lists are generated when the SDK is built and pi-web pins one SDK version, so a model a provider ships after that release is invisible until pi-web publishes a new version (#914). The SDK carries the other half: each built-in provider is wrapped in a pi.dev catalog overlay that `ModelRuntime.refresh()` fetches and persists to `~/.pi/agent/models-store.json`, and restoring that overlay needs no network. Both of pi-web's refresh paths ask for the offline half only (`createAgentSessionServices()` and `lib/provider-usage.ts` pass `allowNetwork: false`), which is why running the pi CLI once used to be the fix — the CLI refreshed with the network on and pi-web read what it left behind.

`lib/model-catalog-refresh.ts` runs that network pass, and **only when the user asks for it**: the "Refresh catalog" button in `EnabledModelsSection` posts to `/api/models/refresh`. Nothing refreshes catalogs on a timer or on another request's path — a pass fetches a catalog per authenticated provider, and a save must not wait on a slow one, the same reason `/api/auth/api-key/[provider]` stores the credential itself instead of calling `ModelRuntime.login()`. `refresh()` is called with `force: true`, since pressing the button is exactly a request to skip the SDK's four-hour freshness window, but *without* `allowNetwork`, so the runtime keeps applying its own `PI_OFFLINE` rule instead of pi-web overriding it; the module reports `reason: "offline"` rather than pretending a pass ran. `shareModelCatalogRefresh()` joins concurrent presses for the same providers so two tabs cannot race over the store file.

Change detection compares the model ids and names the runtime exposes, never the stored bytes: a successful revalidation rewrites `checkedAt` and `etag` on every pass. It only decides whether `invalidateModelsCache()` runs and whether the panel reloads — the overlay itself reaches the UI through the ordinary `/api/models` and `/api/models/enabled` loads, which build a fresh runtime that restores the store, so the refresh route never returns a model list of its own.

### `enabledModels` scoping
The `enabledModels` setting uses pi's `--models` syntax: minimatch globs against `provider/modelId` or a bare `modelId`, fuzzy matching for non-glob patterns, and an optional `:thinkingLevel` suffix. Never compare those patterns as literal strings — `lib/model-scope.ts` delegates to the SDK's `resolveModelScopeWithDiagnostics()` so pi-web and the TUI agree on the visible model list, and falls back to all available models when patterns resolve to nothing. `startRpcSession()` resolves that scope before creating an AgentSession and passes the selected initial model, thinking pin, and SDK-native `scopedModels` atomically; `GET /api/models` reuses the helper only for selector data, `thinkingLevelPins`, and `modelScopeWarnings` display.

Editing that setting from the Models panel goes through `/api/models/enabled`, never through pattern strings composed in the browser. Each toggle is a **minimal edit** of the stored list (`lib/enabled-models.ts`): a pattern that matches no available model is preserved verbatim, only the pattern covering the switched-off model is expanded in place (keeping its `:level` suffix), and every provider that ends up fully enabled with two or more entries collapses back into one glob — pi refreshes provider catalogs from the network into `models-store.json`, so an enumerated list rots when a model is renamed (deepseek's `deepseek-v4-flash` became `deepseek-flash`), while a glob heals itself. A lone exact reference is a deliberate pick and is left alone. **Never assume `provider/*` covers a provider**: pi matches with minimatch, whose `*` stops at `/`, so that glob silently misses every nested model id (`commandcode/sakana/fugu-ultra`, most OpenRouter ids) — writing it turned "enable all" into 15 of 71 models. `resolveProviderGlobs()` resolves `provider/*` then `provider/**` and keeps one only when its match set is exactly the provider's models; a provider that neither covers is written model by model. Also never rewrite the whole list from `getAvailable()` the way the TUI's `/scoped-models` does — it only sees providers that currently pass `checkAuth()`, so that would delete every entry for a provider whose credential is missing right now, and flatten globs and pins.

Disabling the last enabled model is refused with `409 { reason: "last-model" }`: pi falls back to every model when a scope resolves to nothing, so an empty list silently means the opposite. Writes always target the global settings file; a project `.pi/settings.json` replaces the global array instead of merging, so the route reports `scope: "project"`, renders the switches read-only, and returns that file's path as `settingsPath` — the banner names the file it just wrote (`~/.pi/agent/settings.json · enabledModels 20/104`) instead of describing the effect in prose. Built-in *and* extension-registered providers get per-model switches; models.json providers are switched as a whole by `EnabledModelsProviderSwitch` in their detail header, next to Delete, because a custom model can simply be deleted and both bulk buttons only ever sent the same provider-wide write. That switch is on only when every model of the provider is on, so a partial selection reads as off beside the sidebar's `1/2` badge and one click completes it; reading it as "any enabled" would leave partial unreachable in both directions once the last-model guard blocks the way down. Why it cannot move is its tooltip, not body text. `op: "prune"` is the only operation that drops unmatched entries, for cleaning up after such a rename; everything else preserves them. Saving models.json re-reads the switches through `op: "resync"`, which repairs the stored patterns against the new catalog: it rewrites renamed **models** and then renamed **providers**, **cuts back entries whose provider prefix no longer scopes them**, and re-asserts the providers that were fully enabled before the save. (Model references first: they still spell the old provider id, which the provider rewrite would otherwise have replaced already.) All three are needed because a pattern's meaning depends on the catalog. pi matches a pattern against the bare `modelId` as well as `provider/modelId`, so `stepfun/*` also matches another provider's model whose id *is* `stepfun/Step-5-Preview` — renaming a provider to `stepfun` silently enabled three `commandcode` models, and switching stepfun off then wrote them into the file. In the other direction, renaming a model to an id with a slash drops it out of `provider/*` (minimatch `*` stops at `/`), so a fully enabled provider silently loses it. A model renamed in the panel is a known move, not the kind of mismatch worth preserving: leaving `stepfun/ddd` behind after it became `stepfun/ddd1` loses the selection, and when it was the only entry the scope resolves to nothing, which pi reads as "no scope" and quietly enables every model. `ModelsConfig` mirrors every array move of the draft in `savedModelIdsRef` so `collectModelRenames()` can tell a rename from an add or a delete without guessing. Only `resync` repairs entries; ordinary toggles stay minimal edits and never rewrite what the user did not touch. A models.json provider missing from the runtime (unsaved edits, no models, a key that does not work) must not be reported as a sign-in problem, which is why it has its own control: the switch renders disabled with that reason as its tooltip, while `EnabledModelsSection` — now built-in only — keeps the sign-in empty state. See `docs/adr/0004-enabled-models-toggles.md`.

### SSE reconnect on page refresh mid-stream
On `ChatWindow` mount, `GET /api/agent/[id]` is called. If `state.isStreaming === true`, SSE is reconnected automatically. `thinkingLevel` and `isCompacting` are also synced from this response.

### Compaction & summarization-retry SSE events
pi 0.86 emits `compaction_start`/`compaction_end` (the legacy `auto_compaction_*` names are gone — do not re-add their cases) plus `summarization_retry_scheduled/attempt_start/finished` when summary generation enters backoff. `handleAgentEvent` keeps `isCompacting` in sync and mirrors the retry counter into `summarizationRetry`, shown as "Compacting… (retry n/m)" on the compact control. `compaction_end.willRetry` deliberately leaves the counter in place so the countdown stays visible between compaction passes. Manual compact is a blocking POST — the button stays disabled until the response returns. The compact block renders whenever `onCompact && (!isStreaming || isCompacting)`: an auto-compaction mid-run must stay visible and abortable, which is exactly when `isStreaming && isCompacting`.

### 0.86 event surface — the wire forwards everything, the client switch must keep up
`agent-event-wire.ts` whitelists by omission (only `turn_start/turn_end` dropped), so any new SDK event reaches the browser and is silently ignored unless `handleAgentEvent` has a case. Currently handled beyond the message lifecycle: `bash_execution_update` (live `!command` output, tail-capped by `PENDING_BASH_OUTPUT_CAP`), `thinking_level_changed` (immediate selector sync), `session_info_changed` (server invalidates the list cache), `entry_appended` (throttled idle-only transcript refresh — the SDK fires it for extension custom entries and cache warming, never for normal streaming). `executeBash` must `ensureEventsConnected(sid)` *before* dispatching the bash command, or the chunks have no stream to arrive on.

### `isRunning()` must consult the SDK's `isIdle`
pi ≥ 0.86 `isIdle` stays false through auto-retry backoff, branch summaries, and queued continuations — states where `isStreaming/isCompacting/isBashRunning` are all false between events. `AgentSessionWrapper.isRunning()` therefore ORs `inner.isIdle === false` into the flag check; dropping it re-introduces mid-retry wrapper eviction (`evictIfDiskAhead`) and premature idle shutdown. `IDLE_RESET_EVENT_TYPES` includes the retry-backoff events for the same reason.

### Running-state and cross-window propagation
`notifyRunningChange()` fires on `agent_start` as well as `agent_end` (idle → running was never pushed, so other windows' sidebars missed starts), and every `/api/agent/running/events` frame carries `sessionListVersion` — the sidebar refetches the list when the version moves. `session_info_changed` (renames from any window/extension) invalidates the list cache *and* broadcasts a running frame, because that frame is the version's only delivery channel; the running set itself is unchanged.

### Session automation surface (0.86)
`get_state` reports `autoCompactionEnabled`, `autoRetryEnabled`, `steeringMode`, `followUpMode`; the composer's gear popover toggles them through `set_auto_compaction` / `set_auto_retry` / `set_steering_mode` / `set_follow_up_mode`, and `abort_retry` backs the "Cancel retry" link in the retry banner. `useAgentSession.automation` mirrors the four values inside `syncLiveModel` — every get_state path updates them automatically; a new session shows no gear until a wrapper exists (values null). Thinking levels come from `getSupportedThinkingLevels` per model; do not reintroduce a manual DeepSeek xhigh clamp — 0.86 `setThinkingLevel` clamps to `getAvailableThinkingLevels()` itself and a manual `state.thinkingLevel` write bypasses the append/emit path.

### Composer send path is single-shot and guarded
`ChatInput.handleSend` routes slash commands through `runBuiltinCommand` (the pending-guard wrapper) and sends exactly one `onSend` with the `#session`-mention-resolved text. A merge once left a second raw `onSend(msg, …)` behind it: the first send flips `agentRunningRef`, the second hits the running guard and *restores the just-sent text back into the composer* — every message appeared to "stick". `components/ChatInput.test.mjs` runs the extracted handler in a VM to pin one-send semantics.

### `!command` output renders live, then collapses
The pending bash bubble accumulates `bash_execution_update` deltas into `pendingBash.output` and renders them through `BashExecutionView` as a synthesized partial result, default-expanded while running (`ToolCallBlock defaultExpanded`). When the run finishes the persisted message mounts collapsed like any other tool call — live-watched, then folded, is intentional.

### Stats count standalone usage entries
pi 0.86 cache warming appends `type:"usage"` entries (`kind: "cache_warm"`); `lib/session-stats.ts` folds them in exactly like the SDK's `getSessionStats()`. Skipping them under-reported tokens/cost against the TUI.

### Touch affordances
Session rows render the "…" action menu when `(hovered || touchMode)` — `touchMode` is a post-mount `matchMedia("(hover: none)")` check, so hover styling is untouched on desktop and rename/delete stay reachable on touch. On narrow screens a compact Stop button renders *outside* the collapsed "More controls" row while a run is active. Rename/delete failures surface a fixed-position toast (`sidebar.renameFailed` / `sidebar.deleteFailed`) instead of being swallowed.

### Transcript system messages, usage entries and context edits (pi >= 0.86)
- Every new session's first request persists a `message` entry with `role: "system"` holding the prompt sections and tool declarations; later prompt or tool changes append more. The agent loop announces them with `message_start` / `message_end` like any message. They are provider input, never conversation: `toClientAgentEvent()` drops them before the SSE stream (they carry every tool schema), `handleAgentEvent` skips any that slip through, `entryToUiMessage()` returns null for them, and `BranchNavigator` / `lib/project-tree.ts` never label or preview a branch with one. They still count toward `messageCount` and `totalMessages`, exactly as the SDK counts them.
- `usage` entries (`kind: "cache_warm"`) record prompt-cache warming that is billed but never enters model context. `computeSessionStats()` adds them like compaction usage so the token/cost counters match `/session` in the TUI.
- `context_edit` entries omit or replace an earlier entry's model context without changing raw history; the UI ignores them. A retain-none compaction stores its own id in `firstKeptEntryId`.
- `SessionManager.listAll()` now reads files newest-mtime first (then reverse filename) so `--resume` can render progressively; its stable sort keeps that order for sessions with equal activity time, and `listSessionsIncremental()` reproduces it from the stat fingerprints it already keeps.

### Running state polling + reconciliation
- The sidebar polls `/api/agent/running` every 2.5 seconds while the tab is visible and pauses polling in background tabs. The session-list response remains the initial fallback.
- `invalidateSessionListCache()` bumps the generation but **keeps** the previous scan, and the cache is fresh only while its recorded generation matches. Ordinary agent activity invalidates it constantly, and rebuilding costs hundreds of milliseconds because `loadAllSessions()` re-reads every forked and subagent session. Callers that only need metadata — mapping search hits to sidebar rows — pass `listAllSessions({ allowStale: true })` to read the previous scan and let the rebuild happen in the background. A stale scan is a complete catalogue apart from sessions created seconds ago, so those callers accept a brief window where a brand-new session is not yet listed.
- `useAgentSession` treats per-session SSE as primary for chat events and opens it before each prompt. `prompt_done` completes the current UI stage and notification immediately, but the idle SSE stays open for a 30-second grace window and is reused by the next prompt. `agent_start` cancels that close timer; `agent_settled` finishes extension-injected runs that have no wrapper-level `prompt_done` and starts a fresh grace window. Do not close on the first `agent_end`: retries, compaction, and extension-queued messages can continue the same logical prompt.
- While a run is active, `useAgentSession` periodically calls `GET /api/agent/[id]` and also reconciles on `visibilitychange`/`online`. This fixes missed terminal events from background tabs or half-open connections.
- Prompt runs use a monotonic run id; late SSE or slow reconciliation responses from an old run must be ignored so they cannot resurrect stale streaming bubbles.
- Every SSE (re)connection in `useAgentSession` is gated on `sessionHookMountedRef`. React Strict Mode (on by default in `next dev`) re-runs effects in declaration order after a simulated unmount: the mount-only effect's cleanup sets that ref to `false`, and it is only restored when that effect re-runs, *after* the warm-session effect. The warm-session effect therefore re-asserts the ref before `maintainEventsConnected()`. Without it a dev-server tab never opened the event stream on mount or when switching back to a running session, so streamed output and new messages stayed invisible until the 15-second reconcile poll or a page refresh (`next start` was unaffected).

### Per-session scroll restore must be saved before the render-phase reset
Switching sessions resets chat state *during render* (`sessionIdentity !== appliedIdentity` in `useAgentSession`), so the message list is emptied in the same commit — the browser clamps the container's `scrollTop` to 0 before any effect cleanup runs. Saving the position from an effect cleanup therefore records 0 for every switch (which restores as "top of the chat"). The save lives inside the render-phase reset block; an unmount-only cleanup covers ChatWindow remounts (there the DOM is still intact when cleanup runs). Positions and the lazy-load `visibleCount` are cached per session in module-level LRUs (`lib/scroll-memory.ts`): `scrollTop` is a pixel offset into the render window that existed at save time, so `visibleCount` must be restored with it or the offset lands on the wrong message. A viewport at the bottom is deliberately not saved — the restore path then falls back to scroll-to-bottom so users following the tail keep following it.

### The session load must have a deadline
Switching chats does **not** remount `ChatWindow` — `AppShell.handleSelectSession` deliberately keeps `sessionKey` stable so the input dock does not flash. That makes the single `GET /api/sessions/[id]` in `loadSession()` the only thing that ever clears `loading`, and the retry button only appears once the load *fails*. A bare `fetch` there is a hang away from leaving "loading session" on screen permanently, which is exactly what desktop users hit on the first switches after a cold start. It goes through `fetchWithRetry()` (`lib/fetch-timeout.ts`): a hung first attempt is abandoned, then retried once with a longer deadline — the server finishes its cold-start work regardless of the client giving up, so the retry usually lands warm.

### Worktrees and project grouping
- `lib/worktree.ts` resolves linked worktree top-levels back to the main repo `projectRoot`; `listAllSessions()` attaches that to each `SessionInfo` so all worktrees for one repo are grouped together in the sidebar.
- Worktree operations are served by `/api/worktrees` and guarded by the same allowed-root rules as `/api/files`.
- New worktrees are created under `<repoRoot>-worktrees/<sanitized-branch>`. Existing branches are reused; otherwise `git worktree add -b` creates the branch.
- Removing a dirty worktree returns `409` with `{ dirty: true }` so the UI can ask before retrying with `force`.
- Sessions whose cwd points at a removed worktree are inferred back into the main project instead of becoming a phantom project row.
- The switcher also switches the *current* checkout's branch in place: `PUT /api/worktrees { cwd, branch }` → `switchBranch()` (local branch, or `checkout -b --track` when the name exists on exactly one remote). Branch names are validated to not start with `-` — they are passed as git argv, never through a shell. `POST /api/worktrees/fetch` runs `git fetch --prune` (with `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` so it fails fast instead of hanging on a credential prompt) and returns fresh local/remote-only branch lists.
- The sidebar worktree state is event-driven by nature (agent end, cwd switch) — branches checked out *outside* pi would go stale. `SessionSidebar` therefore polls `/api/worktrees` every 10 s while the tab is visible, on window focus, and when the dropdown opens; the `checkedWorktreeCwdsRef` guard keeps those background refetches silent.
- A branch already checked out in another worktree cannot be checked out again (git refuses); clicking it in the switcher jumps to that worktree instead.

### File access allow-list
- `/api/files` is intentionally not a general filesystem browser. Allowed roots come from session cwds, their resolved project roots, `~/pi-cwd-*`, and roots explicitly added with `allowFileRoot()`.
- `/api/cwd/validate`, `/api/default-cwd`, and `/api/worktrees` call `allowFileRoot()` when they make a new location browsable.

### Plugins and skills
- `/api/plugins` uses pi's `SettingsManager` + `DefaultPackageManager` for global/project package install, remove, update, enable, and disable. Disabling writes empty `extensions/skills/prompts/themes` arrays for that package entry.
- `/api/skills` uses `DefaultResourceLoader` so settings paths, package skills, and project `.agents/skills` are listed the same way the runtime sees them.
- Skill toggling edits only the `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter key on the target `SKILL.md`; keep that surgical so user formatting survives.
- `/api/skills/install` shells through `npx skills add ... --agent pi`; project installs run with the selected cwd.

### Built-in subagents
- The global `builtInEnabled` switch is persisted in `~/.pi/agent/agents/settings.json` and defaults to `false` when the file or field is absent. Malformed settings fail closed; atomic updates preserve unknown fields.
- The inline built-in extension factory is always present so reloading an existing wrapper can apply setting changes, but it registers no tools while disabled. After changing the switch, the user must explicitly reload the current session.
- When enabled, only a recognized legacy `pi-subagents` extension that registers any reserved tool (`Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, or `steer_subagent`) is removed. Unrelated extensions remain loaded, and resolved conflict diagnostics are discarded.
- Runtime `Agent` dispatch checks the setting again so a stale tool call cannot start a subagent after the feature is switched off.
- See `docs/adr/0003-built-in-subagent-toggle.md` for the precedence and persistence rationale.
- Individual built-in profiles (`general-purpose`, `explore`, `plan`) are switched off by name in the same file's `disabledBuiltIns` array, never by copying them out to a `.md` file: a copy freezes the built-in prompt at the version it was copied from and is visible to the other runtimes reading those directories. `builtInProfiles()` stamps `enabled` onto the constants so the panel, the `Agent` tool description, and `resolveSubagentProfile` agree; each write is a minimal edit that preserves names it did not touch, including ones no built-in claims (a newer build's). Reading the list fails *open* — the feature switch beside it has already failed closed — while `PATCH /api/subagents/profiles` with `scope: "builtin"` performs the write and `PUT`/`DELETE` still refuse that scope. A same-name file replaces the built-in outright and is switched off through its own frontmatter. Only the switch is live for a built-in; the rest of the form stays read-only. See `docs/adr/0005-built-in-subagent-disable.md`.
- A background run's completion notification (`notifyParent`) is skipped when the parent already collected the same result with `get_subagent_result`: the tool marks a finished background run consumed and the notification takes that mark. The check cannot happen only when the completion promise resolves — the parent is usually still inside its `get_subagent_result` poll at that moment (500ms interval) and `deliverAs: "followUp"` would just queue the duplicate until that turn ends. So `notifyParent` holds the message while the parent `isRunning()` and re-checks the mark before sending; an idle parent is still notified immediately.
- Agent profile files (`~/.pi/agent/agents/*.md`, project `.pi/agents/*.md`) are shared with other runtimes, so a save round-trips the frontmatter keys this app does not own (`name`, `allowed_subagents`, `exclude_extensions`, `disallowed_tools`, …) and carries foreign `ext:` tool selectors through. Managed keys are exactly `description`, `display_name`, `tools`, `load_skills`, `load_extensions`, `enabled`, `inherit_context`, `run_in_background`, `model`, `thinking`, `max_turns`.
- A background run's completion reaches the parent through `sendCustomMessage`, and pi's `convertToLlm` replays every `custom` message to the model as a plain `user` turn. `subagentNotificationText()` therefore prefixes the report with `SUBAGENT_NOTIFICATION_PREFIX` so a compaction pass — whose prompt asks what *the user* wants — does not file the subagent's output under Goal / Constraints (#875). Foreground `Agent` and `get_subagent_result` results keep the bare `subagentFinalText()`: they are already `toolResult` messages and need no marker. Keep the prefix in code, not in a profile prompt, so the model cannot drop it.
- The `skills` / `extensions` spellings pi-subagents reads are seeded on first save and kept in step while they are booleans; a hand-authored whitelist such as `extensions: pi-advisor-flow` is never rewritten, and the two flags fall back to those aliases when `load_skills` / `load_extensions` are absent.

### Web password throttling
- `lib/auth-throttle.ts` is deliberately global, not per-IP: Next 16 route handlers have no socket address and `x-forwarded-for` is spoofable, while the server binds `127.0.0.1` for a single operator. Failures double the delay (1s → 60s cap) for everyone; a success or 5 idle minutes resets it. The reset window must stay longer than the max delay or waiting out one block restarts the burst.
- State lives on `globalThis` under `Symbol.for("pi-web:auth-throttle")` so it survives hot reload and is shared by every module instance. Tests reset it with `recordAuthSuccess()`.
- `POST /api/web-auth` and every `Authorization: Basic` header on `/api/*` share the counter; `proxy.ts` checks Basic before its `/api/web-auth` exemption, so `GET /api/web-auth` is not an unthrottled password oracle. A valid session cookie is checked first and is never blocked. While blocked, Basic gets `429` even with the right password (otherwise the answer leaks), and a Basic success does not reset the counter: Basic clients authenticate on every request, so a reset would restart an interleaved guesser at the base delay. The proxy and route handlers share the `globalThis` state under both `next dev` and `next start` (checked by failing one and observing `429` on the other).
### Auth and model config
- `ModelsConfig` combines models from `~/.pi/agent/models.json` with provider auth status from pi's `AuthStorage`/`ModelRegistry`.
- Provider listing is capability-driven, never id-driven: `lib/provider-listing.ts` decides membership from `auth.apiKey.login` / `auth.oauth` plus the stored credential type, so dual-auth providers (anthropic and github-copilot today — which providers declare both changes between SDK releases, so never assume it from an id) appear exactly once and never fall through both lists (#309). `lib/provider-listing-runtime.ts` adapts `ModelRuntime` to those pure helpers.
- auth.json holds **one** credential per provider and `ModelRuntime.logout()` deletes whichever it is. The delete routes therefore use `removeStoredCredentialIfType()` to compare and delete under the same file lock used by pi's auth storage. `ModelsConfig` also refreshes *both* provider lists after any auth change — refreshing one leaves a dual-auth provider rendered twice.
- OAuth/device-code/manual-code flows are streamed by `GET /api/auth/login/[provider]`; manual code responses POST back with a short-lived token stored in `globalThis.__piLoginCallbacks`.
- API-key routes store and remove keys through `AuthStorage`. Status endpoints must never return the raw key.
- The model test route is `app/api/models-config/test/route.ts`; `app/api/models/test/` is not a real route.

### Completion sound
- `hooks/useAudio.ts` stores the toggle in `localStorage` as `pi-sound-enabled` and reuses one `AudioContext`.
- Browser autoplay policy means sound must be unlocked from a user gesture; `ChatInput` calls the unlock hook from interactive controls, and `ChatWindow` plays the tone from `onAgentEnd`.

### Exported session HTML
- `/api/sessions/[id]/export` delegates to pi's export helper, then patches recursive tree helpers in the generated HTML to iterative versions so very deep linear sessions do not overflow the browser call stack.

### Desktop shell (Tauri)
- `lib/desktop-native.ts` is the only place the UI touches Tauri APIs; every entry point checks `isTauriDesktop()` and degrades to a web equivalent. Tauri commands are declared in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, their permissions in `src-tauri/permissions/desktop-shell.toml`, and both must be listed in `src-tauri/capabilities/desktop-dialog.json` or the call fails at runtime only.
- `/api/desktop/read-images`, `/api/desktop/save`, and `/api/files?...type=import` deliberately accept absolute paths selected by native dialogs, so the normal `lib/file-access.ts` source/destination allow-list cannot cover them (`save` still allow-lists its *source*). They require a loopback Host, normal request-security checks, and the per-process desktop token from `lib/desktop-api-auth.ts`. The Tauri shell passes the token to the packaged server and exposes it to the trusted WebView through the capability-scoped `get_desktop_api_token` command. Never fall back to a static token or User-Agent detection.
- `read-images` caps the file count at `MAX_ATTACHED_IMAGES` from `lib/image-attachments.ts`. Keep it derived from that constant; a separate literal silently 400s selections the composer considered valid.
- Open a local path with `explorer.exe` on Windows, never `cmd.exe /C start` — Rust's argument escaping does not apply to the cmd parser, so a legal path like `C:\src\R&D\x.txt` would split into commands.
- `lib/app-prefs.ts` owns every `localStorage` key. Theme is additionally mirrored into the app config dir via the `set_ui_theme` command, because the packaged server's port (and therefore the WebView origin, and therefore `localStorage`) can change between cold starts.
- `lib/workspace-state.ts` restores the last session/cwd/file tabs on cold start. URL params always win over the persisted workspace.
- `useDesktopConnection` polls `/api/home` only in Tauri to drive the offline banner. Its cleanup must stop in-flight probes from rescheduling, otherwise an unmount leaves a timer nobody owns and it pings forever.

### Workspace terminals & node-pty staging
- Terminal tabs load `node-pty` through a runtime-computed path (`prebuilds/${platform}-${arch}/*.node`), which Next's file tracer cannot follow — a bare standalone build ships only `lib/` and breaks at runtime. `prepare-desktop.mjs` copies the whole `prebuilds/` tree and chmods `spawn-helper` for **both** darwin variants (macOS strips the bit in published prebuilds; `bin/prepare-terminal.js` fixes the same thing at npm-install time). If terminal tabs 500 or hang in a packaged app, check that `resources/server/node_modules/node-pty/prebuilds/` exists with executable helpers first.

### Upstream merge sentinels (not the same "fork" as session fork)
This repo is a fork of `agegr/pi-web` and periodically merges upstream. `components/fork-extractions.test.mjs` guards the failure mode that a clean merge can still be wrong: code this fork *moved* to another file reappears at its origin, or a fork change is silently reverted. Git does not track cross-file moves, so neither shows up in `tsc`, eslint, or the upstream suite.

When one of those assertions fails, the default is to restore the behaviour, not to delete the assertion. A failure saying a marker is "absent from the origin but also from the extraction targets — it looks deleted, not moved" means the feature is probably gone: that is exactly how the project-picker filter box was found missing after a restyle had left every project past the 7-row cap unreachable. Risk levels live in `scripts/fork-ownership.json`; the reasoning is in `docs/ownership-boundaries.md`.

### Topbar, chat column, and right panel — who contains whom
Upstream segment D (0e36743) restructured `AppShell.tsx`'s main region in ways this fork's layout cannot survive; all three are pinned by `components/AppShell.right-panel-row.test.mjs`:

1. The "Center: chat" column must contain BOTH the topbar's chat content AND the chat wrapper. A merge variant closed the column right after the topbar, making the chat wrapper a second `flex: 1` row child — the viewport split 50/50 between an empty topbar-only column and the chat ("huge blank middle column, chat clipped at the right edge").
2. The right-panel toggle/backdrop/resizer/panel block must be inside the row, not after its close: as flex-**column** children of `.app-shell` the closed panel's content height still stole vertical space (`height: 432px` at `width: 0`), floating the composer.
3. The topbar block sits directly under `.app-shell` (full width, above the row) — NOT inside the center column. Inside the column, the right panel's tab strip rose to `y=0` beside the header (overlapping the window buttons) and the topbar shrank to leftover width.

The topbar renders exactly ONE toolbar group (`app-topbar-actions`: history/branches/more + `renderSessionStatsButton`). Segment D also left a second desktop group (`renderChatToolbarActions(false)` — history/generate-title/system/tools) next to it; the duplicate is removed, its unique entries (Sub-agents, Tools) live in the More menu via `handleSystemInfoToggle` (keeping the lazy dormant-session start), and its generate-title guards (persisted-stats counting + `selectedSession.transient` check) were merged into the group-A button — pinned by `AppShell.auto-name.test.mjs`. JSX indentation in AppShell.tsx is unreliable; verify structure with the TS AST or the DOM, not by counting whitespace. `fileContentBlock()` in `AppShell.file-viewer-state.test.mjs` slices source by the panel's closing-div sequence — keep in sync.

### Segment E merge (1eb5e66) — what was adopted and what was declined
Merged upstream 974c8bb..1eb5e66 on top of v0.10.0. Adopted: scroll-to-latest button (with upstream's empty-session branding header, rebranded to PRODUCT_NAME and stripped of the NEXT_PUBLIC version badge per fork branding policy), streaming first-chunk dedup, PDF `#page=` fragments (MarkdownBody's link context + widened onOpenFile signatures), selection-toolbar z-index, subagent/provider fixes. Declined: upstream's sidebar explorer + resizable session/explorer panes (ed50d88) — this fork keeps the project-tree sidebar and the FileExplorer in the right panel; `SessionSidebar.test.mjs` pins that decision, so a future merge that re-adds `data-resize-handle="sidebar-sections"` should be treated as the merge re-introducing declined UI, not as a test to satisfy. Upstream's `/auto-compact` command is superseded by the composer automation gear.

## Pi Session File Format

Location: `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`

```jsonl
{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"<uuid>","timestamp":"...","cwd":"/path","parentSession":"/abs/path/to/parent.jsonl"}
{"type":"model_change","id":"<8hex>","parentId":null,"provider":"zenmux","modelId":"claude-sonnet-4-6","timestamp":"..."}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"user","content":"..."}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[...],...}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"toolResult","toolCallId":"...","content":[...]}}
{"type":"compaction","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","summary":"...","firstKeptEntryId":"<8hex>","tokensBefore":N}
{"type":"session_info","id":"...","parentId":"...","name":"user-defined name"}
```

`entryIds[]` in `SessionContext` is a parallel array to `messages[]` — maps each displayed message back to its `.jsonl` entry id, used for fork and navigate_tree calls.
